        <h1>Introduction to making scripts</h2>
        <h2>
            First off, you want to make a new folder in res/scripts/ and call it your script's name
            Make a new file in that folder, call it "index.py",
            Nice! now you have a empty script, you can start off with making a simple print, save the file!
        </h2>
        
        <div class="source" style="font-size: px; line-height: px;">
            <ol class="python"><li class="li1"><div class="de1"><span class="kw1">print</span><span class="br0">(</span><span class="st0">"my epic script just ran"</span><span class="br0">)</span></div></li>
        </ol></div>
        
        <h2>
            Now, if you get a message, it wont work, well that's because we haven't added it to the config yet
